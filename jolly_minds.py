"""
To make a post using the Minds social media API in Python, you will need to do the following:

Obtain an API key for the Minds API. You can do this by signing up for a developer account on the Minds developer portal (https://www.minds.com/developers).
Install the requests library in Python. This library allows you to make HTTP requests in Python. You can install it using pip install requests.
Make an HTTP POST request to the /api/v1/newsfeed/single endpoint of the Minds API, using the requests library. This endpoint allows you to create a new post on Minds.
In the request payload, include the text of your post and any other desired parameters, such as the visibility of the post (public or private).
Here is some example code that demonstrates how to make a post using the Minds API in Python:
"""
# post to minds using python minds api
import requests

# Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Set the text of the post
text = "This is a test post from the Minds API created with openAI"

# Set the visibility of the post (public or private)
visibility = "public"

# Set the endpoint for creating a new post
endpoint = "https://www.minds.com/api/v1/newsfeed/single"

# Set the request headers
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}

# Set the request payload
data = {
    "message": text,
    "access_id": visibility,
}

# Make the POST request
response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=data)

# Print the response status code
print(response.status_code)

# Print the response content
print(response.content)
